frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

This is the third project for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. The focus of the project was to use object-oriented JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas to build a basic arcade game. 

## How to Play:

See how many points you can accumulate! Every Gem is worth 10 points. Reaching the water returns you to the starting point without a gain or loss of points. 

You're going to need to clone the game from github:
